# Installation

There are two ways to get started using orchestration in your Laravel application.
But before we dive into them, we must first require the package using Composer.

```bash
composer require payavel/orchestration
```
Then you may either choose to configure the package [via command](#via-command)
or take the high road and [do it yourself](#manual-configuration).
